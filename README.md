#Spring Micro Service Architecture

## Micro Service
A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.

## API Gate-Way
An API Gate-Way is an abstraction layer between Client Side and Server Side , So Clients don'nt need worry about implementation of different Modules in microservices.
Most widely used API GateWays used are :
1. AWS API Gate-Way
2. Azure API Gate Way
3. MuleSoft
4. Kong Gate-Way
5. Google API Gate-Way
etc...

## Things Covered in this Project
1. What is Micro Service , and How it can be implemented in Real World
2. How Servers can be used to handle different Micro Service and there request (In our case we have used Eureka Client Discovery & Eureka Server)
3. How Fault Torelence Can be acheived using Hysteris when cosuming different Micro serivces
4. How API GateWays can be used to interact betweendifferent microservices (For Demo pupose Spring Cloud Gateway is used)
